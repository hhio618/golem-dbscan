# DBSCAN on Golem

## Overview

This is an implementation of the [DBSCAN clustering algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN) 
on top of [Golem.network](http://Golem.network/). It is based on my original work on top of the Apache PySpark, see [here](https://github.com/hhio618/dbscan-pysprak).
### Golem map reduce
This uses the [golem map reduce](https://github.com/hhio618/golem-maprerduce) project to run map reduce programming model on top of the Golem.network.
